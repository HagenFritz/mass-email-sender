# Sending Mass Emails with Python
This project rose out of the need for the office team at [Austin Learning Center](http://austinlearningcenter.com) to update their process of sending work schedules to tutors. Their old system was contained in a "black box" so they had no idea to how to debug issues. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to be able to send out mass emails to addresses provided in a file and include attachments in each email that correspond to the individual. Additionally, we want:
* **robust and easy-to-understand documentation** so anyone can easily diagnose and debug issues _if_ they arise
* **an executable or single command** to run the program
* **to provide a teaching opportunity** for those interested in learning how Python can automate simple tasks with relative ease
* **to integrate testing and code coverage** so that we can understand the moment something goes awry

## How the Program Works
We borrow much of the code from this [article](https://realpython.com/python-send-email/) which also provides some nice details regarding the process.
